Randomly generate advice presented in modern aesthetic styling! Do note that some of the advice will be nonsense for the time being because astetik utilizes a free advice api. I am currently working on compiling my own set of advice.
## ðŸ‘‰ Get Started
Install dependencies
```

Install the Netlify CLI
